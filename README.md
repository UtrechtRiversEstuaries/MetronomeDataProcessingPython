# MetronomeDataProcessingPython
Files for processing raw data from the tidal tilting flume 'The Metronome' in Python

## DEM processing
* NetCDF2Plots.py

This file creates basic plots from Metronome DEMs in NetCDF format

## Other files
The other scripts necessary to process the raw Metronome data do not yet exist in Python. Some are well written in Matlab, others need a major overhaul when they are implemented in Python
